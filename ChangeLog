  * features/sqs/messages.feature, features/sqs/queues.feature,
  features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb, lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb,
  spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb: Implement SQS long polling

  Changes within AWS::SQS:

  * Queue#poll now accept a :wait_time_seconds parameter which sets the
    maximum amount of time that SQS should long poll for.
    Defaults to 15 seconds. To use the default set for all messages
    on the queue, pass in nil.
  * The :wait_time_seconds default does not apply to
    Queue#receive_message. For this method, you must pass the option
    directly, or set the global Queue#wait_time_seconds long polling
    value.
  * Added Queue#wait_time_seconds attribute to set the queue-wide
    long poll timeout value. This setting applies to all calls to
    Queue#receive_message or Queue#poll
  * Deprecates the Queue::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL constant
  * Queue#poll no longer uses :poll_interval; use :wait_time_seconds
    instead.
