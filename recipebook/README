== Recipe Book Sample Application ==

This application demonstrates some of the features of the AWS SDK for Ruby. To
run it, you must put your AWS credentials in a file named <tt>aws.yml</tt> in
the <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config</tt> directory. For example:

  access_key_id: MY_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_access_key: MY_SECRET_KEY

Once this file is in place, you can use the rails console to create the
SimpleDB domain that the application will use:

  $ rails console
  > Recipe.create_domain

Then you can run the application locally:

  $ rails server
